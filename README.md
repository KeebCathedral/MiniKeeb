Want to edit your keyboard layout? You can find the required `.json` and `.hex` files [here](https://github.com/KeebCathedral/MiniKeeb/tree/main/keymaps).

This is your main typing layer, very similar to that of a regular-sized keyboard.

In addition to the default key layer, there is a numbers/symbols/punctuation layer easily activated by holding down the "layer raise" (red) key and contains virtually everything else a typist will need.

On top of this, activated by holding down the "layer lower" (blue) key, is a function/navigation/system layer where there are function keys, media keys (purple), and navigation cluster (yellow), in addition to the PrintScreen/ScrLock/CapsLock keys.
